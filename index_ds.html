<div> Earthquakes in California and Puerto Rico, joined by a single line. We have the magnitude also present when we click on the bubbles.</div>

<div> Visualization: Project Three</div>
<div> This map shows us the free wifi hotspots in the city with heat map indicating the areas with most hotspots. We also have citibike data overlayed on top of the wifi data. We can see the hours that are busiest for bike start time and the gender of user for the stops.

I would have had a menu with the hours so that we can see what the busier and not so busy times are. ALso would have liked to connect the wifi hotspot clusters with each other, calculate the distance between them and also see if there was an overlap between these and the bike routes around them.

Another cool piece of info would be the number of bike collisions with the locations they occur in and if there is any overlap between them and the busy bike check out hours. Would like to play with the data sets more and make the torque cooler by throwing in connecting lines showing the intersections of bike routes along with check out hours.</div>
